### Instruction
#### Part A
In this part of the assignment you are provided a list of mutual funds and the companies that were dropped from their portfolios. We want to obtain the 10-K filings for these companies. In the file (Dropped_Companies.csv), there is a column called "Name of Stock". Load the file, extract a list of all the companies in that column, then find the 10-K links for all these companies. Feel free to utilize Beautiful Soup and Pandas.

#### Part B
Your task in this assignment is to scrape the first 3 pages of quotes from the following website:
http://quotes.toscrape.com/js/
You will need to do this using selenium because the webiste uses javascript to render the content. You will use the chrome driver as discussed in class.
Your code should output a csv file with 2 columns. The first column has the person who stated the quote and the second column has the text of the quote.
