J Wata Temaki Bar,Anna B,It&#39;s a temaki/hand roll restaurant and the chefs just hand you each temaki one by one! I went for happy hour from 3-5pm over the weekend and there were amazing deals with a great variety. All the seating is high tables surrounding where the chefs make the food so it is really fun watching most of the food get made. <br><br>Alberto was the main chef making our rolls and he was extremely personable. He kept up a fun conversation with us, and really made us enjoy our meal. Paola was a fabulous waitress as well, she was very attentive and always made sure our orders were sent in when needed. <br><br>The restaurant is clean, there is fun music being played that isn&#39;t too loud, beautiful artwork surrounding the walls, and delicious food. The menu is obviously larger during regular lunch and dinner hours so I am excited to check it out then! <br><br>Parking is pretty packed because of all of the popular business, so be open to using street parking if necessary.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Joshua F,First impression on the location, very hard to find parking considering the fact that there are many food places to eat here. The sushi bar is decent sized, kid friendly.  I made reservations fearing that it may be busy, but to my surprise it wasn&#39;t as we saw many walk-ins getting seated right away. Our host/hostess was very good at providing quick service, from getting our seats and refilling water and taking our orders from the menu. We did notice one sushi chef taking care of us, as well as many others, maybe too much for one person to handle, sushi here is made one at a time and follows the order they receive it in. I noticed some people waiting longer than usual to get their grub on and it might just make some people restless and hungry waiting for their turn. In my opinion they could&#39;ve used one more chef for providing faster service.<br><br>Anyways the food part, me and my girlfriend ordered the &#34;shi&#34; combo each. It consists of 4 different pre-set rolls. The sushi is given to you one at a time. (Side note, chef gave me a sushi roll that I didn&#39;t order and I got it free of charge! Lol) All I can say was the sushi is fresh and delicious. The one thing I liked about it was they toast the Nori (seaweed) on an open flame which gives it a smoky flavor and crunchy texture with each bite. I&#39;d recommend going to this sushi spot if you want something for a change.<br><br>This has been my own opinion about this place, I encourage you to open your mind and try it for yourself.<br><br>From your friendly neighborhood spider- oh wait yelper! Itadakimasu!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jonathan P,I dig this place. I came in right as they opened at 12:30 so it wasn&#39;t too busy.<br><br>I ordered the Go Set and an extra Negi Toro Roll. Everything was hand-made in front of you and extremely delicious. <br><br>I did receive an extra roll towards the end which I&#39;m not sure if it was complimentary or if I received someone else&#39;s by mistake. Either way I wasn&#39;t charged extra. I&#39;d hope that in the future they have some sort of system to prevent something like this from happening (like a list they can cross off) or clarify that you are receiving an extra roll on the house.<br><br>I&#39;d recommend coming to this place for a quick bite with a friend or two.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Lucy K,J Wata resembles KazuNori in LA with its menu options and quality of handrolls. You can order their set menu or ala carte. Happy hour is such a great deal too! Really good handrolls for super cheap - who can pass on that? I&#39;m surprised this place isn&#39;t always packed. There&#39;s never a wait here, which is a plus, and service is always great. Parking is the worse, however, so try to find street parking if you can.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Anna L,I am a fan of J Wata Temaki Bar!  I was here for dinner one night and came back the next day for lunch with some coworkers.  When empty, the overall experience was wonderful.  We got a chance to talk to the chef and inquire more about the rolls.  When busy, it&#39;s a little tougher.  The place is small, and like any place, it can be understaffed sometimes.  We waited 30+ minutes for our check so that was a little rough.<br><br>Onto the good -- the hand rolls!  They have predefined sets for lunch and dinner.  During lunch, there are some lunch specials which are nice.  I need 3 hand rolls to feel full, and it is nice to try the different ones available.  My favorites are the blue crab, salmon, and some of the vegetarian rolls.  If you&#39;re ordering anything to go, I do recommend just placing the order at the beginning of your meal depending on how busy the restaurant is.  <br><br>While there, I noticed that there were many people who did not remember what they ordered.  Or the chef makes a handroll and hands it to someone, and they&#39;re like &#34;I didn&#39;t order this.&#34;  There seems to be a need for a system to keep track of the rolls where both the customer and chef know exactly what is meant to be made.  I would hate to see rolls wasted just because it wasn&#39;t something someone ordered or wanted.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Martha W,I like the concept, and have been here 2 times before and enjoyed the garlic edamame and the dynamite,  which is a small portion of a mixture of seafood baked with mayonnaise I believe. It is very good. So when my husband wanted to come here again I figured I would order those again but guess what? No dice. They are out of all the apps and the yellowtail. That is gross negligence on the part of management! So this time I am just getting one salmon skin Temaki. Will finish this after I get it, as it takes longer than the other rolls. I do think that toasting the seaweed is a nice touch. The roll is about a 3 star  due to the chewiness of the seaweed and is small at about 5 bites. Could use more flavor. Happy hour is a pretty good deal, as well as the daily lunch specials.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Heather P,My favorite sushi place!  So fresh and delicious.  My favorites are the hamachi and negi toro.  They have a great lunch special with miso soup, salad, and two hand rolls that I get at least once a week!  The chefs and staff are so friendly.  It&#39;s my go to.  Don&#39;t ever change J Wata!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jessica C,Such a fun and delicious eating experience. We love coming here for just a snack or for a full meal. Everything is worth trying.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jessica D,What I ordered: lunch special with one non premium (Negi salmon) handroll + a wagyu handroll + miso soup + salad ($10.95)<br><br>Taste: portion was good for lunch, the two dishes I got didn&#39;t really have sauce so if you like a simple flavor of the fish/meat this is good for you <br><br>Service: great service, very friendly<br><br>Parking: small lot (really hard lot to park in) park in street,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Sarah C,Awesome little Temaki spot!! My husband and I came here today (Saturday) and had a reservation at 7:15p. We came early but were able to be seated right away as it wasn&#39;t super busy.<br>Atmosphere was great! I liked how the seating was set up in a U-shape so that the chefs serve each temaki directly to you. They have to be eaten right away in order for the seaweed to stay crisp.<br>The menu is small but they also have specials written on their board inside the restaurant. We decided to order a la carte and ordered 5 rolls each. My husband ordered monkey balls as well.<br><br>I got the hamachi golden-ratio, bay scallop, negi toro, blue crab, and uni. All of my rolls were delicious and had nice, toasted seaweed! I do think my Uni, however, didn&#39;t taste as sweet as I&#39;d like. It had a more bitter taste. I did like how our chef didn&#39;t actually add the shiso leaf, which I think it standardly come with. It probably would&#39;ve overpowered the uni. My favorites of the rolls were the hamachi and the blue crab. Yum!<br><br>My husband ordered negi salmon, negi yellowtail, negi toro, salmon skin, and Maine lobster. After he took a bite of each roll, he would look at me and smile with approval, haha. <br><br>The monkey balls did take a little while to come out. Our chef gave my husband a hamachi roll during our wait. Not sure if it was by mistake but my husband took it anyway and said it was delicious! I looked at the receipt after our meal and we weren&#39;t charged for the extra hamachi roll. Score! Oh, the monkey balls were yummy by the way. It&#39;s like a deep fried sushi. It came with 4 half pieces and you gotta be careful eating them cuz they were hot. Give them a little time to cool before chomping down on those balls. <br><br>Our chef was awesome, servers were nice but could use a little more training because we were kinda lost in the beginning with who was actually our server, what to do with our paper, and had to ask for water refills when our cup was completely empty. I rate it 4.5 stars and rounded up to 5 for our great chef and delicious food!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Kristine D,I love this place! Their hand rolls are delicious and made right in front of you. It&#39;s a pretty small spot so if you know ahead of time that you wanna eat here, I definitely suggest that you make a reservation. It&#39;s inside the business area of Tapioca Express, RakiRaki, and O&#39;Briens. It&#39;s a VERY busy and tiny parking lot. <br><br>Here, you can order a set of 3, 4, and 5 temaki (hand rolls) and it&#39;s a set menu. They&#39;re small but filling, and you&#39;re not allowed to share. But why would you wanna share it&#39;s so gooood. They have vegetarian options, and a la carte as well. My bf and I both ordered 4 hand rolls, and some off the a la carte menu. The nori is toasted, and hand rolls are made right in front of you. The fish tasted really fresh, my bf had the wagyu and said it was delicioussss<br><br>Staff here is really nice. They try to pay attention and interact with each customer. It&#39;s basically one big table with the chefs inside, and the seats are formed in a U shape. The art on the wall is pretty neat too! I definitely would come back again,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Joyce C,I&#39;ve been here quite a few times, so it&#39;s about time I left some positive feedback. Prior to coming here, I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of hand rolls, so I&#39;m not really sure what possessed me to try this place out to be honest. Either way, it was a great decision and now I love hand rolls as long as they&#39;re made here. <br><br>These hand rolls are cylindrical, instead of the traditional conical shape. This allows you to eat the filling, rice, and nori at the same time instead of being left with just rice towards the end. Also, the rolls are made one by one so they don&#39;t get cold or soggy. I&#39;ve had the dinner sets a couple times - I usually get set 4 or 5. Both are very good, depending if you want 4 or 5 hand rolls. They now have lunch specials too - house salad, miso soup, and 2 hand rolls. A la carte is always an option too. James has been our sushi chef the last couple times. Not only does he make a good roll, but he&#39;s funny and is also a great conversationalist.<br><br>Overall, super happy that I got to try this place out. It isn&#39;t in the best lot on Convoy, but it doesn&#39;t deter me. Try this place out if you haven&#39;t already!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Sam S,Located in convoy, right next to Crab Hut.....so obviously, the parking SUCKS, BUT....the sushi is really good. Made to order right in front of you. Something about their rice and seaweed, it makes the sushi!!!! The warm ness of the seaweed in every bite you take is delicious. The spicy salmon is my favorite so far, but honestly, they&#39;re all good!! The service can be a wait though.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Tina S,First time eating at a Temaki bar. Came here after a late lunch so mainly here to feed my eyes and camera. <br><br>They have preset combos or you can choose your own. I tried the Negi Toro, Maine Lobster, and Uni with Shisho. Would skip the Shisho in the uni with shisho. Even though shisho tastes good, I felt that it overpowered the uni. Definitely enjoyed the crispy seaweed experience. Can&#39;t really tell how fresh the toppings were but I can tell that it wasn&#39;t bad. <br><br>Price is fair. The staff was tentative. Chef was awesome and accommodating. Glad we were able to squeeze this meal into our trip.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Vincent T,TL;DR - Very good, but expect to pay for it. It&#39;s pretty good quality fish and so the price reflects the quality and experience.<br><br>I got the five-set and have had it a few times now, taste is very consistent throughout all visits.<br><br>1 - Salmon <br>By far the best one, 10/10 would definitely just order 5x of these and be happy.<br><br>2 - Lobster<br>It&#39;s alright, it&#39;s claw meat so it&#39;s so so.<br><br>3 - Spicy Tuna<br>Honestly I don&#39;t really like spicy tuna ever, so I just chug this one down with water and soy sauce<br><br>4 - Hamachi<br>Very interesting fish and comes with greens inside. Very unique and I enjoy it.<br><br>5 - Scallops<br>Once again, kind of an odd mix, but still very delicious.<br><br>Overall, this place is great :) and deserves the five stars for great atmosphere and food!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Megan F,Jer and I each did a preset flight of rolls and then added one additional special roll. Each roll was individually crafted and the flavors were fantastic. Everything tasted fresh and tenderly crafted.<br><br>The staff was super friendly and attentive. <br><br>Our compliments to the chef!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jenny T,I came here with a group for a little snack because we were waiting for another reservation but got too hungry during the wait.  The counter is set up in that U formation so everyone is sitting in a single line next to each other. <br><br>This place only does hand rolls.  What&#39;s nice about it is that they make the hand rolls fresh and in front of you, and then hand it right over to you, so you&#39;re getting it right when it&#39;s made.  They lightly toast the nori with a small flame, so it&#39;s slightly warm when you bite into it.  It also comes out pretty quickly.  <br><br>I ordered the Bay Scallop Hand Roll ($5).  Definitely small for $5, there&#39;s no way you could get full off of just one.  But for this visit it was fine because we only wanted a small snack.  I don&#39;t recommend this place if you don&#39;t like mayo, because a lot of the hand rolls on the menu contain mayo in them. <br><br>This is definitely not a place for you to just hang out and chat with your friends.  They try to get you in and out as quickly as possible, even if you&#39;re the only group in there.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here for a complete meal, because you&#39;re not going to get full from here.  This place is best to go to if you&#39;re not that hungry to begin with, or if you want a small snack.  It&#39;s also pretty pricey for the size that it is, but I&#39;m sure it goes to the quality of the ingredients.  You also can&#39;t split their set menu which is a bummer.<br><br>The hand rolls that we tried were pretty good, so it was a pleasant experience for my first hand roll place.  Just note that it&#39;s not a sit down and loiter kind of place.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jay O,I can&#39;t see this place surviving.<br>I&#39;ve tried to like it after about 5 or 6 visits but it just isn&#39;t happening.  Service is always very bad even on a very slow day. The waitress doesn&#39;t seem to know what&#39;s going on and the kitchen side isn&#39;t much better.  Pace is always very slow and they always seem to be training someone new to make rolls.  (I&#39;ve never seen the same person in the kitchen twice except one guy).   Fish quality is nothing special and the specials haven&#39;t changed since they opened (many months ago).,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Trish S,Sushi isn&#39;t hard to find in San Diego, but unique sushi is more of a challenge! This spot has been on my radar for awhile and it ended up being my first night out since the birth of my daughter. <br><br>A girlfriend met me here and we sat at the bar. It was a weeknight at 630 but I had a reservation regardless - it&#39;s a tiny place! We order drinks and some delicious and super garlicky edamame to start. It was the tail end of happy hour so we got some discount on our order. <br><br>Temaki is aka hand rolls, and if done well can be a really true expression of what sushi is really all about: the high quality fish, perfect rice and seaweed of course! We really enjoyed everything we had here and the staff was attentive and Chef CHEF JUNYA WATANABE was delighted to create.<br><br>Note that each roll is made to order so settle in for a bit and try the yellowtail! It was my favorite of the night. <br><br>Parking in this shopping center is the worst. You&#39;ve been warned.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jimmy D,3.5 Stars<br><br>Cool concept as you can easily drop in for a handroll or few.  Rolls came out fairly quick after ordering and they only make one at a time for you so that it is eaten fresh.<br><br>The rice is fairly warm and the nori was lightly toasted for a slight crisp on the first few bites.  The raw seafood was fresh and prepared well.  I got the &#34;Go&#34; premium set.  I felt that there could have been more protein than rice.  There was also more mayo than I wanted in some of the handrolls.<br><br>Blue Crab - Sweet crab flavor, mixed with mayo<br>Spicy Toro - fatty and not as spicy as expected.   <br>Negi Salmon - good flavors and nice texture. Probably my favorite<br>Bay Scallop - I love scallops but this had way too much mayo<br>Maine Lobster - Good tasting lobster with just enough mayo in it.<br><br>Overall - this is a great snack.  5 rolls wasn&#39;t enough to fill me up, but I didn&#39;t want more either.  Getting the set is a better value but i&#39;d like to skip all the rolls with mayo, which seem to be a lot of them.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Lili T,J WATA!!! I&#39;ve never been to a restaurant and experienced this type of dining experience before and I really enjoyed it! I can&#39;t lie - I took advantage of the BOGO Grand Opening deal!<br><br>I went once with my friend&#39;s deal and we got the Go which included 5 handrolls per person - Maine Lobster, Spicy Tuna, Negi Salmon, Scallops, and Blue Crab. It was so delicious, I went again the next day with my little brother! I love that each handroll is made right in front of us and the seaweed is roasted over the open flame. They tell us to be sure to try and eat it quickly so that we can experience the crunch of the nori - YUM is all I can say! Having that crunch of the nori is the added bonus to a well crafted roll! <br><br>Ranking the rolls from my most favorite to least favorite: Maine Lobster, Negi Salmon, Spicy Tuna and Blue Crab tied, and scallops. I don&#39;t absolutely LOVE the scallops with mayo which is why I ranked it as my least favorite. All rolls are crafted with hot rice and rolled like a burrito style rather than a cone. <br><br>Our service was top notch and I&#39;m excited to come back here when I&#39;m back in town - however, it is kind of pricey without the deal!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jasmine C,I love that convoy is opening all these new restaurants. J wata sells premium hand rolls. Their menu is set and they will not adjust unless you have allergies. <br><br>Tbh, this is my first hand roll experience so I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to but it was good!<br>My friend and I signed up for their grand opening BOGO special through Facebook. It&#39;s happening the weekend of 7/13-7/15 and 7/20-7/22. <br><br>The interior of the place is simple and I really liked the art of the wall. There&#39;s limited seatings so the wait can take some time. Each hand roll is made fresh and the chefs don&#39;t make the next one until you&#39;re done with the one in front of you. It&#39;s best to eat it quickly or the seaweed will soften and makes it harder to bite <br><br>I ordered the &#34;GO&#34; which is 5 hand rolls. <br>Spicy tuna - fresh<br>Negi salmon - one of my favorite. It was simple. Can&#39;t go wrong with salmon. <br>Maine lobster - fresh but had a lot of mayo <br>Blue crab - also fresh and covered in mayo <br>Bay scallop - probably the best one. It was light, fresh, and nicely coated in a sauce.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Theresa N,Hubby and I were so excited to check out this place last weekend, we got there 45 minutes before opening to get in line, lol.  I can officially say that was probably not necessary, as other people didn&#39;t actually show up until maybe 15-20 minutes prior.  Alas however, our over-achievement paid off!<br><br>Seating in this place is limited.  Maybe about 15-20 people inside at a time I think.  You get seated around where all the action is and they make your temaki right there!  You can order the temaki by sets, or a la carte.  We decided to go with Set Go (5), which includes:  Maine lobster, blue crab. spicy toro, negi salmon and bay scallop.  Also ordered the hamachi sashimi as well as the uni ikura temaki.<br><br>Let me tell you, eat the roll as soon as they hand it to you.  They are tasty and fresh as hell.  Like, complete melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  Everything in the ingredients, down to the rice, is perfection.   Also, they use premium soy sauce, which is superb with the rolls.  You&#39;ll wonder why you never ate them like this before!<br><br>I joked with the hubby and said I could eat this everyday.  I haven&#39;t, but have been several times this past week =P.  Take all my money already, Junya!!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Desmond F,4.5 stars<br><br>A premium hand roll experience, everything is made fresh and just before you eat it. One can get rolls a la carte or there are there are set menus San (3) Shi (4) and Go (5) and if you&#39;re not picky is the way to go to get the price breaks. We ordered two Go sets and a few a la cart to try everything we wanted. In the end we tried the Maine Lobster, Bay Scallop, Spicy toro, Negi Salmon, Blue Crab, Shabu Wagyu Beef and Unagi.<br><br>Everything was very good, what stood out to me was the smoky crunchiness of the nori. It starts out lovingly flame kissed and then only when it is warmed and toasted is it used.  Most places the nori is a mass produced after thought, there just for the structural integrity of the roll or handroll. But here it is your introduction, the beautiful edible wrapping paper of a tasty gift to your palate. <br><br>Of the 7 rolls I had the opportunity to try the blue crab was the one that stood out to me. After the first bite the flavor hit me as a reminder of how a premium Japanese taste experience is really just a moment of simple yet eye opening tranquility. It was just a fleeting few bites but so awakening. <br><br>J/Wata is not for all, the wait will invariably be long because of the limited seating (I counted about 20) so a large party will not do well here. It is also located in the my least favorite part of Convoy, the Parking lot from hell. Even with the set menus it is expensive for the amount of food your are getting. Perhaps not the most effective price point is reached here but transcendence comes at a cost and I&#39;m glad there exists those who reach for that, even for a few bites.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jocy C,4.5 Stars!!<br><br>This is my first time at a Temaki Bar (specializing in hand rolls)!  J Wata Temaki Bar is currently in soft opening (as of June 2018).  The creator is Junya Watanabe (also the creator of RakiRaki Ramen and Pokirrito Poke).<br><br>We tried the following:<br>- Salmon Sashimi<br>- Steamed Edamame<br>- San Temaki (Blue Crab, Negi Toro, Spicy Salmon)<br>- Bay Scallop Standard Roll<br>- Maine Lobster Premium Roll<br>- Negi Toro Premium Roll<br>- Ikura Premium Roll<br>- Uni Ikura Premium Roll<br>- Ozeki Nigori Sake<br><br>Loved the food and freshness overall.  <br>#NOMNOMNOM,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Charles M,Why doesn&#39;t this place get more traffic? An underrated gem in the middle of a busy mall. <br><br>Came for a Saturday night dinner and there were only four others in the restaurant. <br><br>The hand roll style here is interesring - every meal plays out at a slow and steady pace, roll by roll. I ordered the &#39;Go&#39; from the menu and was very happy. You can watch as every roll is made before your eyes. Be warned, it&#39;s a slower pace and may not be for everyone. I liked it though.<br><br>The rolls themselves are delicious. They toast the nori on the outside so every roll you get is fresh and warm. And oh, the fish! Their fish is wonderfully fresh.<br><br>One gripe though: even with so few people in the restaurant, the waiter service was very poor! Waters were not filled, we were generally not checked up upon.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jiaxin G,I got the weekend one grand opening BOGO special so  we used it for our lunch on Sunday afternoon. We got there around 1:50 and there&#39;s a line of about 10 people waiting already. It&#39;s not too bad even though we waited a little more than half an hour cause we were able to get some boba tea while we waited. <br><br>The restaurant have only about 22 seats but the turn over was decent. There were two chiefs making hand rolls for everyone. I feel like this temaki bar is not so much for hanging out. It just doesn&#39;t feel right to keep the seats for a long time while there&#39;s a line waiting outside the restaurant.<br><br>Anyways, we got the &#34;Go&#34; hand roll set (~$22 at regular price for 5 hand rolls). It came with spicy tuna hand roll, scallop hand roll, Maine lobster hand roll, blue crab hand roll and salmon hand roll. The shape of the hand rolls was not what you normally see in other sushi restaurant. The fillings sat in the middle of the hand roll and the two ends had a little hollow space. I didn&#39;t like this shape cause I couldn&#39;t dip the rice in the soy sauce dish. <br><br>Our favorite was the spicy tuna hand roll. It&#39;s got the right amount of spicy and the tuna didn&#39;t have the metal taste. It tasted fresh. My second favorite was the scallop one. Although it had mayonnaise, I still tasted the sweet flavor in the scallop. The Maine lobster and the blue crab hand rolls both had too much mayonnaise. And the salmon hand roll tasted interesting with the scallions. <br><br>For some reason the wasabi we had was not spicy at all. We like how wasabi normally get so spicy the taste go up your nose. However, we put chunks of wasabi in our hand rolls but it&#39;s only very mildly spicy. <br><br>The service was good. The interior design was cool! I like the wall painting very much. However, due to the open front door, fly get in and the inside of the restaurant could be a little warm. If you mind a fly hanging around while you eat, I suggest you don&#39;t come here (see my picture). <br><br>I am glad we got the BOGO deal to try this restaurant out. Otherwise I would rather spent couple bucks more to get AYCE.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Nick W,This review is based on the promotion they had when they had their grand opening for BOGO. after just having gone to Kazunori, I didn&#39;t want to compare the two but each provide different experiences and it was hard not to. <br><br>I think that overall J Wata has a lot to offer and their hand rolls are very good. <br><br>Just like Kazunori, this place has a long wait even with the reservation to save a spot. After already having difficult finding a parking spot, we finally got to waiting around for another 30 minutes. <br><br>Once walking in, the ambiance is way different from Kazunori since it was more lit.  The room felt more welcoming and had really awesome art on the walls. So we decided to order the Go set selection of rolls and I also got the Uni Ikura. <br><br>I have to say that I actually enjoyed the nori here more than the nori from Kazunori, however my girlfriend felt that here the nori stuck to the top of her mouth more.<br><br>I decided not to take pictures because I wanted to immerse myself in the experience. <br><br>The roll I remember the best and would definitely order again would have to be blue crab. To me it seemed like it was the perfect amount of crab within the nori and that it tasted the best to me. The presentation order of the rolls seemed different to me, but that&#39;s according to the chefs and so I can say that it was great to have the contrasting tastes. I also enjoyed the bay scallops roll and the spicy tuna. <br><br>I would definitely recommend going here to try it out, there&#39;s so much it has to offer and they do offer other rolls and some sashimi! Just hope you can find parking!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Ryan C,J Wata is going to be added to my very short list of restaurants I&#39;ll be a regular at.  <br><br>They have a very fresh take on Temaki and rather than create a &#34;cone&#34; they roll it like a &#34;tiny burrito&#34; so you get the same consistency of ingredients in every bite.  It&#39;s smartly done. <br><br>I ordered the five-piece meal which includes hamachi and scallops and every single bite was heaven.  The seafood was incredibly fresh and it was wrapped in warm, crispy nori that had been cooked over a Shichirin Grill--the same time of grill Ariana Grande had tattooed on her hand (lol)...Which as an aside, is still something I&#39;m extremely amused by.  <br><br>Lastly, their hot green tea is the best I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s thick and full of tiny green tea flakes floating in the mixture.  It is hands down better than the tea I&#39;ve had at nearly every other Japanese restaurant.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Dung N,It was a spontaneous Friday night and we decided to do our last pit stop here to check out their soft opening phase. My friends ordered the &#34;San&#34; and &#34;Go&#34; set menu. Set menu items can not be shared or substituted.<br><br>I was just finishing my dessert as we walked in here, so I wasn&#39;t too hungry, but couldn&#39;t resist ordering something, so I got a roll. I decided on the wagyu shabu premium temaki hand roll. They roast every seaweed paper on this cute little open flamed rock, so it has a really nice flavor. Then, for my particular roll, the meat is cooked in broth- shabu style, and then the rice is added and rolled together. <br><br>It was one of the tastiest hand roll I have ever had! My friends also enjoyed everything they got as well. Service was also fast and friendly. We were able to chat with the owner for a bit. I will definitely come back with a bigger appetite and try one of their set menus next time.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Saleen D,If you love hand rolls, J Wata Temaki Bar is your place!<br><br>This is owned by the same owners as RakiRaki &amp; it is just a few doors down from it.  Very busy parking lot!  Save your car from getting a ding by parking on the street!<br><br>Very friendly &amp; attentive customer service!  I love the restaurant&#39;s style: a large, hollow square table with the chefs in the middle, seating around the perimeter, &amp; beautiful art on the walls.  On top of that, the hand rolls are phenomenal!<br><br>I came hungry &amp; tried the following.  All were superb, with my favorites being the Blue Crab, Spicy Salmon, Spicy Toro.<br><br>Negi Salmon<br>Spicy Salmon<br>Blue Crab<br>Spicy Toro<br>Unagi<br>Wagyu Shabu,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Tiffany T,Neat concept. The &#34;Go&#34; ($27) and &#34;Shi&#34; ($22) sets were delicious. Good seafood. Favorites were the blue crab, negi salmon and negi yellowtail and bay scallop. The sushi rice is really good.<br><br>Most of their rolls are gluten free, and they have gluten free soy sauce. <br><br>The portions are good for lunch. It&#39;s an expensive lunch though. Since each sushi chef manages 11 seats, the pace/service could be a little slow as you wait for your next roll. My fiancé and I got two sets and dined for a little over an hour. <br><br>I did find a hair in my rice that fell out. (If my rice didn&#39;t fall out, I wouldn&#39;t have known.) A little gross but I got it replaced immediately. Accidents happen...,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Sarah C,Must try spot if you love hand rolls! I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon with my bf. As we are diehard sushi aficionados, we&#39;ve always wanted to try a Temaki spot. During our visit, there appeared to only be 2 workers (one chef &amp; one server) while the restaurant was pretty full for a Monday afternoon. It took us a while to get seated since the 2 workers were trying to manage the workload. As an appetizer, we also ordered from the seasonal specials, the Kanpachi (Amberjack) sashimi. Since it was our first time at a Temaki spot, we decided to try the set menu &amp; so we ordered &#34;Go&#34; which included 5 Temaki &amp; miso soup. The price wasn&#39;t bad for the amount you get but if you order from the set menu, there are absolutely no substitutions. <br><br>The Kanpachi sashimi was amazing! Kanpachi is one of my favorite fish for sushi &amp; it didn&#39;t disappoint. It was very fresh &amp; light; we could&#39;ve easily devoured an entire plate of it! The first Temaki was the Negi Salmon &amp; it was great. Salmon isn&#39;t typically one of my top picks but the freshness &amp; quality won me over! The second was the Maine Lobster. The lobster was cooked to perfection &amp; there was a good balance between it &amp; the sauce it was mixed with. I always fear that the delicate flavor of the lobster would get lost in excessive amounts of sauce. The third was the Spicy Tuna which had a good kick of spice but we thought it was just alright. I thought that the Spicy Tuna wasn&#39;t anything special because personally, it always has that same, one note flavor to me regardless of where I try it from. I think there are other fishes that have flavors that are more profound &amp; unique. The fourth was the Hamachi Golden Ratio &amp; it was the BEST! The name for this Temaki was very appropriate because the flavors were cohesive in the marinate of the fish. The fifth &amp; final was the Bay Scallop &amp; to be frank, it was a bit of a disappointment. Like the Maine Lobster, the Bay Scallop was also tossed in a sauce but I thought the sauce was overwhelming, heavy &amp; clouded the delicate, subtle flavor of the scallop. <br><br>In terms of service, it did take some time for us to finally start receiving our Temaki&#39;s because the chef was swamped &amp; looked like he was pretty behind on orders. On a good note, reinforcements arrived from the back so there were 2 more workers alongside the chef. At this point, the food was coming out faster but I can tell the patrons who were there before us were pretty frustrated, possibly wondering why these workers didn&#39;t come sooner. The chef even apologized to some patrons, assuring them that this service doesn&#39;t reflect their regular service. Unfortunately, we received our Kanpachi sashimi at the end of our meal because the chef forgot about it but it was delicious nonetheless. <br><br>Overall, we had a great first time experience at a Temaki restaurant. The ambiance is great &amp; the place is very trendy &amp; modern. I love how all the seats are bar style so that you can observe the chefs &amp; they hand you all the pieces directly. One of my favorite things about the food is that there&#39;s a perfect balance in flavor, texture &amp; proportion between the rice, the crispiness of the roasted Nori &amp; the fish elements. I could tell they utilize high quality ingredients not only for fish but also for the Nori &amp; the sushi rice prep. Though the food doesn&#39;t come out fast, I appreciate the time that goes into hand making each piece. Having dined at quite a few traditional, Japanese sushi restaurants, I knew that those chefs like to take their time to perfect each piece so we came in knowing it wouldn&#39;t be a fast dining experience. They also recommend that you eat every piece as soon as it comes out &amp; for good reason because the crispy, roasted Nori is a major component in Temaki &amp; if you wait too long, it&#39;ll get soggy. I&#39;d love to visit again but I think I&#39;d order a la carte next time to try the other selections!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Hillary F,We ordered the monkey balls, Negi salmon and salmon skin roll plus the San (3) Tamaki set which comes with miso soup , a negi toro, blue crab, and spicy salmon roll.  Everything tastes fresh and you can tell the ingredients are of high quality.  We will defiantly come back here next time we are in the area.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Ashley D,I was ecstatic to see a hand roll place pop up in SD as I have been wanting to try Kazunori in LA but have never gotten the chance to. This small store is opened by the owner of Pokerito and Raki Raki, so you can bet its located right in the same plaza. <br><br>A friend and I came at 11 before grand opening and we were the only party eating except one other party. We went with the Shi ($16.95) that came with 4 handrolls. Each one was prepared right in front of us. It was fascinating watching the chef crisp up the nori over the fire and roll each hand roll carefully. You really do have to eat each one fast as if not, the seaweed gets soggy and the rest of the rice and fish can fall out of the end of the roll. The warm rice is one of my favorite about this place and places like Sugarfish. If you have not tried sushi with warm rice and it sounds odd to you, try it here! It is amazing. My favorite roll was the yellowtail one as it was the lightest and most natural in flavor. <br><br>Because it was only in soft opening, I had very low expectations and was not expecting to be impressed by anything here. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The fish tasted fresh and the warm rice and crispy combination was great. I don&#39;t know if I would come back any time soon as the wait will probably tremendous, but its a great experience to have at least once.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Christopher S,A very nice change up from your normal sushi spots.<br><br>Food and service is incredible. Depending on how busy it is it may take some time for you to get your first set of hand rolls but it is definitely worth the wait. <br><br>Highly recommend going during happy hour so you can get drinks and some rolls at a discounted price which makes the experience more worth it.<br><br>Must try!!!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Emmett T,I had been waiting for this place to open when I first heard about it last year. It&#39;s a small, chic bar that seats roughly 20 people so I guess I was fortunate when I arrived as only about half the spots were occupied. I parked a couple of blocks away and walked over since I knew it would be a crap shoot trying to find a space in that plaza.<br><br>After you are seated, the server explains how to order the hand rolls from the menu sheet. You mark what you want and then hand the slip to him/her who then informs the chefs behind the bar on what to make. The best value comes from ordering one of the three preset options. I chose the Go ($21.75) which came as five rolls: Blue Crab, Spicy Toro, Negi Salmon, Bay Scallop, Maine Lobster. I also picked a Wagyu Shabu roll ($7.75) a la carte.<br><br>I liked how the chefs took each piece of nori and warmed it to a crisp over a gas flame before adding the ingredients. Each roll came out cylindrical in shape (instead of conical like at most Japanese restaurants) and was handed to you individually as the chef finished wrapping it. All the components tasted very fresh. My favorite of the ones I tried was the bay scallop.<br><br>The a la carte prices were pretty reasonable as I normally see hand rolls selling between $4 and $5 apiece. All the regular temaki were priced less than $5 while the premium temaki ranged from $5.75 to $7.75. They are currently in their soft opening for the remainder of this week. The plan is to go to their full operating hours early next week according to one of the managers who checked up on me before and after my meal.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Curtis T,We were trying to get into Kura Robota Sushi Bar. After waiting for 45 minutes, we did a Yelp search and found J Wata Temaki Bar. This is a new restaurant in an area that is packed with Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Japanese restaurants. There are no tables, but only sushi counters. The restaurant primarily serves rolls. There are specialty rolls from 3 (San) to 5 (Go). The Go is the best &#34;bargain&#34; at under $22, which includes spicy Toro and Maine lobster rolls. They heat the nori (seaweed), which is a nice touch. <br><br>After a nice dinner of 14 hand rolls for the two of us for about $60, we were buzzed by Kura that our table was ready. I will take quality over quantity and will return to J Wata Temaki on my next visit to San Diego.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Catherine F,I am a sucker for hand rolls, and being from Los Angeles I have not found that restaurant to give me that fix here in San Diego. <br><br>Soft Opening, but was really well put together. The space was all in the middle and for everyone seated to experience and be close to the sushi chef. <br><br>For my Temaki:<br><br>I chose the Shi, which included (4) handrolls:<br>*Blue Crab<br>*Negi Yellowtail- fresh yellowtail and great on the palate.<br>*Spicy Tuna- just enough spice<br>*Bay Scallop- mayo delicate taste and was one of my favorites<br><br>I couldn&#39;t resist, and tried from the a la carte as well:<br>*Spicy Toro- give me that tuna belly, savory and perfect<br>*Uni- it was different with some mint added and tobiko. I enjoyed this handroll the most!<br><br>Each Nori is toasted before preparing each handroll, so your handroll is handed to you by the chef each time warm and ready to eat. <br><br>I would definitely come back!<br><br>Staff- attentive and management as well <br>Parking- it&#39;s Convoy/Kearny Mesa parking at all those plaza&#39;s equals patience.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Lily N,I think I found my new favorite place? <br><br>Came here Saturday night for dinner with a friend. We made reservations -- it seems like a safe bet since its a small place and a wait could build up pretty fast.<br><br>I had the &#34;San&#34; set menu, which came with three handrolls -- Toro, Spicy Salmon, and Blue Crab. I was hesitant to order this since it seemed like a pretty small portion, but the amount was perfect for me (not hungry, but not hate-myself-I&#39;m-so-full). The TORO was by far my favorite, but all three are great choices. Each were super fresh and had absolutely no &#34;fishy&#34; smell to it. There&#39;s a sufficient amount of mayo in it but not too much, in my opinion. The spicy salmon wasn&#39;t like the traditional ones you get in cut rolls or poke bowls -- it had the perfect amount of kick without destroying my palette.<br><br>We also got a sake flight. It was ok, but don&#39;t know if I would order it again. I&#39;d rather opt for a beer or just one singular type of sake (its nice they give you a &#34;sake scale&#34; ranging from sweet to neutral to dry).<br><br>The only think to be cautious of is the parking because the lot is super teeny and an absolute nightmare!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Kim P,Best hand rolls I&#39;ve ever had. Enjoyed everything but favorites were lobster and scallops hand roll. The crispy shrimp was also delicious. Would definitely recommend!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Katie B,Delicious. I love the concept since I&#39;m a huge fan of temaki. You can order a set of 3, 4, or 5 temaki (hand rolls). They also have an a la carte menu if you&#39;re looking for specific items like uni and ikura. The sets are definitely the way to go to save a little money. I had the set of five: negi salmon, Maine lobster, spicy tuna, hamachi, bay scallop. My mom had the set of three: negi toro, spicy salmon, blue crab. She also had an uni ikura roll. All the rolls were great - delivered straight to the hand by the chef. The rice was pretty good, but could have had a bit more vinegar. At least it wasn&#39;t too sweet like a lot of sushi places. The fish was fresh and the nori was nicely toasted right in front of us. There&#39;s nothing like the combination of fresh toasted nori, warm sushi rice and cold fish! <br><br>We made a reservation, but didn&#39;t actually need it when we came at noon on a Sunday. You might need it during happy hour, which looks pretty good. Discounted rolls and beer! Overall, we had a good experience and I liked that we were able to get in and out of this counter joint fairly quickly.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Grace S,Came here for their grand opening week 3 to get the opportunity to utilize their BOGO, and chose their &#34;GO&#34;  set with 5 hand rolls at 21.95:<br>- salmon<br>- blue crab<br>- spicy tuna<br>- bay scallop<br>- maine lobster<br><br>Other choices would have been the 3, 4 or vegetarian set menus, in which you can see if you browse pictures of the menu. You can also order a la carte.<br><br>Everything feels very specialized here, as I feel like how most Japanese restaurants are. The seaweed is first lovingly roasted over a flame before being wrapped around warm sushi and delicious cold fish.<br><br>The chef is attentive as well as the other servers here, setting out ginger and wasabi, a wet paper towel (one of those in plastic), and a tray of soy sauce, which was pretty concentrated. But of course the star of the experience were the hand rolls. The hand rolls are simply just rolled into a straight roll, not into the triangle/pyramid wrap that so many of are used to at certain restaurants, which makes it easier to dip in the soy sauce.<br><br>With each roll, I would take at least one bite without dipping it in the soy sauce and honestly, all of them can be deliciously consumed in that manner as they all had very distinct and strong flavor. My favorite that stood out for me was the maine lobster. The texture just worked for my tongue. Usually I&#39;m much more of a crab person, so I was surprised the blue crab wasn&#39;t my favorite. However, all of them were excellent and one could definitely tell the quality of the fish.<br><br>These are premium hand rolls, so they come at a price. Don&#39;t expect to be stuffed after eating here unless you want to spend a lot.  The experience also comes at a premium with only about room for 20 people here, with about two or three chefs (so the rolls come fast). We were lucky that we had 0 wait as I have heard others waiting an hour sometimes.<br><br>I really like the decor, the art murals, and just the general feel of the place. Trendy but not overly gaudy or modern yet tasteful - like at an art museum.<br><br>However, just a note that this place is at the complex with the Convoy parking lot from hell, so plan accordingly to either come at off-peak hours or give yourself time to find parking on the street.<br><br>I&#39;m really happy that a place like this exists in San Diego - perhaps the restaurant scene has finally arrived since a restaurant that specializes in something as niche as hand rolls opens here.<br><br>The whole experience was very pleasant, and I had a terrific time dining here. I&#39;ll definitely be back, when I&#39;m craving for some really great hand rolls :),
J Wata Temaki Bar,Leslie B,Wow!  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  I went because the Yelp review of the day suggested, and it looked like a good idea.  I went on a week night with my sushi-loving cousin.  I really love hand rolls, but had never been to a place that specialized in hand rolls.  We made reservations just in case, but there was no crowd on a week night.  It was chilly, so I ordered hot sake.  My cousin, who is super selective in her sake, chose as well, and found some to her liking.  <br>The menu has several options, including a chef&#39;s selection of 3, 4, or 5 items.  We chose the four item menu and an appetizer of hamachi cevice.  The service was great. Our server set us up with the sake and the appetizer.  We communicated with our chef about our chef&#39;s selection.  The fish was fresh and delicious.  The hand rolls were delicious and I absolutely crave them today.  I am definitely happy to have discovered this place and I will be back.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Johnny N,The &#34;Go&#34; set menu is the way to go as it will save you approximately $5 from ordering the 5 handrolls individually.  All the seafood used are extremely fresh and the habachi grilled seaweed makes a wonderful warm crunchy wrap.  I was a little disappointed they had no uni today.<br><br>My favorite are the bay scallops and especially the blue crab.  They are both so sweet and fresh.  But the blue crab is what will keep me coming back for more since blue crab hand roll serving restaurants are hard to find in San Diego county.  I would even probably just stop by to get myself a few blue crab handrolls as a snack.<br><br>I am not cheap on my food but I do find the handrolls to be somewhat small &amp; expensive.  To make yourself full the final bill tally can get quite high.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Julie N,Wow, if I wasn&#39;t a struggling college student, you would 100% see me here every week. I came in on a Friday around 5ish with my friend. My friend and I wanted to get Cauldron, but we wanted to get something small and savory before we got ice cream. <br><br>We saw that J/Wata was open so we went to try it out. This place only serves hand rolls and the menu is small, but boy did everything sound amazing. Hand rolls were around $5-6 per roll, a little on the pricey side but for the fresh ingredients, I totally understand why. <br><br>My friend and I just wanted 1 roll each because something savory for our taste buds was all we wanted. I got the negi toro and she got the avo/wasabi/mayo. The chef prepares it right in front of you and personally gives you the hand roll. The roll was so flavorful with really great ingredients, you can taste how fresh it was. I&#39;m not even a fan of mayo or wasabi, and the avo wasabi mayo roll was so good. <br><br>Staff members and the chef were super nice and welcoming! I can&#39;t wait to return, but definitely with my mom or dad next time!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Deaj Q,First time at a temaki bar. Both of my parents are avid fans of Junya Watanabe, so visiting here didn&#39;t surprise me. My dad and I ventured in while waiting for seats next door at Junya&#39;s neighboring ramen shop. We were honestly looking for just appetizers and a drink or two and ended up spending a cool $75 sans tip. L O L. <br><br>(We ordered: negi toro, spicy salmon, bay scallop, shiitake shoyu, uni with shiso, unagi x2, wagyu shabu, a beer, and the sake sampler)<br><br>James was our chef for the majority of the meal and I think Kim was our host. The meal and service are very structured and for good reason. Order your hand rolls and drinks by notating them on the provided check list, Chef will hand them to you, one at a time, as they are made. D E L I C I O U S. But I can see how the service structure is helpful when it is extremely busy. <br><br>I can&#39;t tell if it was because my dad was generous from the alch or if we were both just genuinely enthused in our experience but we spent more than enough on our original plan for appetizers and drinks hahahaha.<br><br>All of the hand rolls we ordered were fantastic. All of the fish and even vegetarian rolls were premium and exceptional quality--so for me, at this point, decision-making is a matter of what your taste preference is. Of honorable mention, I really loved the bay scallop. So creamy and sweet. Chef offered us palate-cleaning rolls at the end: a pickled radish handroll and a ginger shiso handroll. Both were tasty but if we were to choose one, the ginger handroll reigned supreme. <br><br>Thank you, j/wata Temaki Bar!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Akemi W,Very expensive. Very delicious.<br><br>These rolls are made fresh with crisp nori, hot rice, and cold fish. Each one is prepared as you eat it, so there&#39;s no takeout, no fancy presentation, no piled plate to take photos of. I could see this taking quite a long time, but I timed my visit for the murky too-late-for-lunch-too-early-for-dinner time and had the place to myself. Even as the only customer, the staff was attentive (but not hover-y), the rice was fresh, and the meal was delicious.<br><br>This is definitely a good place to come if you want to eat excellent, quality food without being too fancy.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Helena Q,WOW!<br><br>This place is delicious!!  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in SD now.  The chefs who prepare the hand rolls take great care, and let me tell you, every single hand roll my friend and I tried was great.<br><br>It&#39;s a small restaurant, with a nice ambiance.  Great date spot!  Each hand roll is made to order and only after you finish your last one does the chef make another.  <br><br>The concept is that nori is wrapped into a cone with rice and fish.  The nori is toasted over a high flame, so that it doesn&#39;t taste chewy - thank you!  The fish tasted fresh, and the rice was perfect.<br><br>Since the dessert shop, Angels &amp; Hearts, is opened by the same owner, you can even get a discount if you go after dinner by showing your receipt!  What a sweet deal!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Yueming Q,I&#39;m so happy to check out this place. It is a very small restaurant which is a little difficult to find because it doesn&#39;t have obvious name mark on the door. But once you walk in, you will love this bar style restaurant. You can get very close to chef, watching them make beautiful and delicious hand rolls. This restaurant&#39;s price is very reasonable, especially if you come here at happy hour, you can totally enjoy a full nice meal in very good price! I highly recommend.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jessica T,Tasty and satisfying hand rolls that are worth the price! You can choose from a set menu and/or buy rolls individually. <br><br>Ordered the Go set ($21.75) which comes with salmon, lobster, spicy tuna, scallop, and blue crab hand rolls and added on a blue fin tuna roll ($4). They were all pretty good, but my favorites were the salmon, lobster, and scallop. <br><br>My friend ordered the uni ikura roll and was impressed with it as well! I usually find ikura too salty, but I really liked the sample I was given. It&#39;s first washed to lessen its saltiness. Then it&#39;s marinated overnight in a soy sauce (?) mixture, which gives it a flavorful yet delicate taste.<br><br>I&#39;d come back if I&#39;m ever down to splurge to try the rest of the menu! <br><br>*This place is better than kazunori in LA.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Kendra A,This place IS SOOOOO TASTY!!! Their lunch specials are fantastic and super affordable. It&#39;s a tiny lil place but man it&#39;s absolutely delicious and the employees are the sweetest. Kim, you&#39;re awesome! <br>We got the Hamachi Kama and duuuuuude so fresh! Finger lickin good :),
J Wata Temaki Bar,Michelle N,My fiancé is a huge hand roll fan, so we came here for lunch over the weekend. It&#39;s a small restaurant with a U-shaped communal table that allows you to get real close to your neighbors and the sushi chef. (This place is in that convoy tapx plaza where green tea house cafe used to be..10 years ago lol.)<br><br>Food is delicious and filling. We each ordered the 5-roll pack w an extra specialty roll apiece. Hands down my fave is the lobster hand roll. Oh and the buttery delicious bay scallops roll. I&#39;m still having dreams about them!!!<br><br>Gotta give a shout out to the awesome sushi chef, James. I love watching food network, so I was thrilled when he answered a few of my questions and explained how the rolls and their components are made. I think a lot of times in these smaller restaurants, the atmosphere is really set by the chef, and he did a great job setting the atmosphere.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Evee N,Came here with a fairly large group, knowing we might have to split up or deal with a longer wait. Good thing it was a Monday afternoon, they were able to seat 6 of us altogether. Like previous reviews have mentioned, it&#39;s a slower paced meal since you are being fed only as fast as your chef can go.<br><br>SHI - 4 handrolls<br>Blue Crab - this was my least favorite of the 3, all I could taste was the mayo<br>Negi Toro, Spicy Salmon, Bay Scallop - all so simple, yet tasty<br><br>Unagi - this was a slightly different flavor that I still enjoyed. Unagi is usually prepared with a sweet sauce, and @J Wata the sweetness is toned down.<br><br>I liked that we could watch the chefs prepare the handrolls, from toasting the nori to placing it in your hand. Though it was good eats, it wasn&#39;t amazing amazing y&#39;know?,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Annie L,YES. JUST YES! If you love Temaki (hand rolls) you&#39;ll love it here. The Bay Scallops, Spicy Tuna, Wagyu Shabu are absolutely delicious! They have a special Temaki right now, Spicy Jumbo Shrimp Tempura which is also amazing. You also have to understand that your entire dining experience will take over an hour, your Temaki comes out one at a time, so expect to wait. All in all, A+!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Katherine H,First to pop up in San Diego. Delightful culinary experience. The seafood was fresh and hand rolls made one at a time with care. There are only a few seats, which causes a line. Everyone was amazingly helpful and nice. The blue crab and spicy tuna hand rolls were my fave. Great date night location.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,teresa v,I&#39;ve been here now a handful of times and it has yet to disappoint! Highly recommend going for the 5-set so you can try more of a variety and to fill up -- and 3 to 4 is not enough to get full. LOVE how the chef gives it to you one at a time and roasts the seaweed as he goes (always great seeing Chef Mas behind the bar, whether to watch over the other chefs or making the rolls himself).<br><br>I would say this place has not yet been fully discovered (yay for me!), but would def recommend others check out this hidden gem!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jinna K,Not my style. Super bland and really, nothing extraordinary. We got the 5 hand rolls each. It was spicy tuna, bay scallops, Maine lobster, blue crab and salmon. The lobster, scallops and crab are slathered in mayo. I felt like they really didn&#39;t take advantage of the fresh seafood natural flavors and was geared towards a more mainstream, &#34;American&#34; flavor. They didn&#39;t taste bad, just very bland and lackluster. The chef (James) was very courtesy and did what he could do. We ordered a few specials/appetizers and one of them came with miso soup. We asked if we can get our miso soup since it took a while, the waitress said we had to order it so we told her we ordered a the set of 5 Temaki and it came with it. She then said &#34;did you want it?&#34; We just said yes....<br><br>The service wasn&#39;t terrible. Our waiter was fine and chef was nice. It&#39;s just one chef for the entire table but he was able to keep up with the pace. I think they could improve on really amplifying the freshness and quality of the fish rather than slathering it mayo. It tastes so Americanized like a Cali roll. <br><br>It&#39;s just not my taste. I can see why people love this place and have it good reviews, it&#39;s just not my preferred taste. <br><br>Also, keep calling the grated chopped wasabi &#34;fresh&#34; wasabi when it&#39;s not. Idk where people get this from but I would have to assume they were told that. <br><br>I, personally would not recommend. But again, It&#39;s just not my preference. I can see someone trying to transition from California or philly rolls to sashimi that want to be &#34;adventurous&#34;.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Rony Y,The food is very good. The service not that much, they are understaffed, and they are slow between hand rolls.<br><br>Also, the place does not close at 9. I have gotten there 4 times at 8:15 and they wouldn&#39;t take me, even with the place empty.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Brandon F,I&#39;ve been excited to try this place since they opened, but I&#39;ve always assumed it&#39;s super busy.. especially being located in such a busy area in Convoy. To my surprise, there was no wait on a Friday night at 7:00 pm! It was near empty, with just 1 couple dining upon our arrival. I also found parking right away, I&#39;ll admit that was sheer luck. <br><br>I love the concept and simple menu. You order your hand rolls, and they make them fresh for you one at a time. This makes for a fun and unique dining experience that ultimately fills you up. It&#39;s also pretty quick, we were in and out fairly fast. <br><br>My girlfriend and I had 5 hand rolls each. Keep in mind, they&#39;re not as big as your typical hand roll at other places, but don&#39;t over order, because you could always order more later. <br><br>My girlfriend&#39;s favorite was the main lobster. My personal favorite were the shiitake and yellowtail. We ordered the wagyu, and it was mediocre at best. Then my toro was just okay, for all I knew it could have been regular tuna. <br><br>Overall I&#39;d rate the experience 3.5 stars, but going to round down. $75 later including tip for 2, it was fun, but not memorable. To their credit, the service was good, and it&#39;s a nice and quick dining experience. Then make sure to try the shiitake. Unfortunately the wagyu was a disappointment, and the toro was questionable. Then the overall fish quality was not any better then your average sushi place, so I&#39;ll likely not be back.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Ryan R,My girlfriend and I come here often for their happy hour. The main chef here is always friendly and provides us with a great experience that keeps us coming back. The happy hour can leave you with a much cheaper bill while still eating quality hand rolls. I recommend the negi toro hand roll.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Joel P,A great place for a casual lunch with great food and service. Went there on a date and it was a great experience we both enjoyed it very much we felt comfortable the entire time and the food was fantastic.If you don&#39;t know what to order ask the chef to make something up, it worked out wonderfully for me.!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Thuong T,Three Words: Premium hand rolls.<br><br>I love the uniqueness of this Japanese restaurant, specifically brought to you so that you can enjoy a whole new experience of sushi.<br>It is indeed, a very simple dish, and you&#39;d imagine &#34;how hard could it be to mess up?&#34; Well darling, you can. <br><br>&#34;THE PRECISE COMBINATION OF SUSHI GRADE FISH, WARM RICE AND CRISP SEAWEED, PAIRED WITH CHEF WATANABE&#39;S SECRET SAUCES CREATE A UNIQUE DINING EXPERIENCE.&#34;<br>- CHEF JUNYA WATANABE <br>(CREATOR OF RAKIRAKI RAMEN AND POKIRRITO POKE)<br><br>HAMACHI SASHIMI<br>Super fresh slices of hamachi, drenched in a flavorful sauce, and topped off with a spicy kick of jalapeno. It is one of my favorite dishes and they did not disappoint.<br><br>GO [5] TEMAKI <br>(All hand roll combos cannot be substituted or shared)<br><br>BLUE CRAB(GF) - The crab was immensively flavorful. My second favorite.<br>SPICY TORO (GF) - Fresh, Yummy<br>NEGI SALMON (GF) - Fresh, Yummy<br>BAY SCALLOP (GF) - The scallops were beautifully marinated in a creamy sauce. My favorite!<br>MAINE LOBSTER (GF) - Fresh, Delicious<br><br>UNAGI (Premium Roll/A La Carte) - Super tender and slightly sweet, delicious!<br><br>Overall, all the ingredients, from the slightly crisped Nori seared over an open flame, to the tender rice, to the freshness of the proteins, and the subtle but flavorful sauces, to the customer service was wonderful.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Lori T,Came in during their soft opening and I&#39;ll start by saying that I&#39;m looking forward to seeing their menu expand because everything that we ordered was good.<br><br>The hand rolls are made fresh one at a time in front of you and it&#39;s best to eat them right away to maintain the fresh crunch of the seaweed. My mistake was taking my time in snapping pics of my first few handrolls haha. The blue crab and scallop rolls were my favorite - the blue crab was slightly sweet and the meat was refreshing, light, and fresh by the smell of it. The scallop was just the same - slightly sweet with a clean aftertaste and texture. The salmon and hamachi sashimi were both served with just the right amount of accompanying ponzu and wasabi and the slices were fresh. My rec is to go for the &#34;shi temaki&#34; which is an order of blue crab, negi yellowtail, spicy salmon, and bay scallop handrolls then you can order more as you please. I&#39;d skip on the Maine lobster - it&#39;s not out of the ordinary. <br><br>I think that the way the rolls are served should be changed - rather than handing it directly to the customer, it could be placed in front of them. I felt like I was going to drop my handrolls because it&#39;s a little awkward having to grab/set the roll in your hand. Just my two cents! <br><br>Overall, I highly recommend for the experience and quality of food. The parking lot isn&#39;t great as it is the same one shared with Tapex and Tofu House and if you know, you know...,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Rae C,I decided to treat my boyfriend to date night. We really enjoy sushi, and we haven&#39;t found our &#34;go to sushi spot&#34; since moving away from Long Beach. I wouldn&#39;t say J Wata hits the spot for us, but we did enjoy our dining experience while here. <br><br>Many sushi documentaries will explain the true passion that goes into sushi rice alone before discussing the fish. Every part of sushi making (nori, rice, fish, presentation...) is very methodical with intense attention to detail. At J Wata, I definitely got to taste of that kind of passion. Our sushi chef was very kind to make our hand rolls and explain his process, even talking about the fish and flavor notes to consider while eating. He educated us on eating sushi and his personal opinions, and was even throwing in some fish humor. It made the date more memorable than I even planned. <br><br>Food alone it was good, but having that kind of customer service was truly special. Regardless of the crappy parking lot, or maybe the fact that we were the first patrons of the night and it wasn&#39;t busy at all during our time, this place is simply dope.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Lydia T,I love when an establishment sticks to one thing and does it well! J Wata is the spot for yummy small handrolls with crisp seaweed. OMG.<br><br>It&#39;s just a small u-shaped bar, modern and intimate. <br>The miso was tasty! <br><br>We selected the &#34;Go&#34; (means 5) (x2) so we could sample their offerings. Our fave was the negi salmon. I also really liked the spicy scallop (not spicy but yummy creaminess) and the blue crab. We needed another negi salmon and the uni a la carte. The uni was very refreshing with an oba leaf and roe. <br><br>The staff were very nice and attentive. They adjust the pacing accordingly and we were never without a hand roll for long. I can&#39;t wait to go back! <br>Arigato gozaimasu,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jasmine C,S P E E C H L E S S ! I have been to many sushi places and this place is one of its own kind. <br><br>The experience was different here. You walk in and there is only a round about bar setting. You sit as if you are in a bar but you order sushi. The sushi is made for you one by one and they hand it to you one at a time. Similar concept to as if you are ordering a drink at the bar and they hand you one drink at a time. <br><br>Everything is premium and fresh. Customer service is great. The Sushi Chef was very attentive and he went along with our instagram posts. He smiled on camera when we took pictures of him preparing our food. He was entertaining. <br><br>I just hoped the restaurant would be bigger with more seating. There is a higher demand I noticed. My friend and I waited about an hour and a half to get seated. <br><br>Parking is a mess but there is street parking as well. The food is worth having a struggle with parking.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Tiffany L,I&#39;ve been here twice now, once during the soft opening and the second time during their grand opening when they had their set menu BOGO.  There are only around ~20 seats so while this makes for an intimate, authentic atmosphere reminiscent of a sushi restaurant in Japan, it is probably not the best place to go if you have a party over 3-4 people.<br><br>This place is great if you&#39;re not super hungry and you&#39;re looking for quality/freshness over quantity.  They only serve hand rolls and each roll is prepared fresh to order and should be consumed within seconds of receiving it from the chef.  While I do appreciate this concept, it does make the meal last longer and the pacing of your meal is at the mercy of how busy the restaurant is.  You should expect to wait 5-10 minutes between each roll.<br><br>However, the service is very attentive from the chefs, servers, and manager.  The chef always asked me how each roll was in between rounds and seemed genuinely interested in my response as opposed to just asking for the sake of it.  The servers came around often to refill waters as well as their high quality soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi.  I normally don&#39;t even like sushi ginger but I really enjoy the freshness of the ginger here!<br><br>The food itself is delish.  I had the Shi and Go menus during my respective visits.  The chefs hand-roast the seaweed before filling it and that crunchy exterior really ties everything together.  All the fillings are fresh and seasoned well.  My favorites are probably the salmon, yellowtail, and lobster rolls :),
J Wata Temaki Bar,Marika D,Man, I had such high expectations for this place being an avid consumer of seafood and Japanese cuisine. But it really did not live up to it in the slightest bit. <br><br>For a place that specializes in hand rolls, they sure make a sloppy one. It&#39;s very hard to eat without them falling apart. I do like that they warm up the seaweed and that it has a nice crunch. But inside the nori is 75% rice. Very little seafood, which wouldn&#39;t be an issue if the price was affordable. But these are expensive handrolls at $5-10 each. <br><br>The San, which included Negi Toro, Spicy Salmon &amp; Blue Crab, was very unsatisfying. They were all so heavily marinated that you couldn&#39;t taste the fish itself. Especially the crab was more mayo tasting than anything.<br><br>We also ordered the hamachi sashimi to get a change from all the rice. Yellowtail is my favorite fish, and I find that it is usually good even at mediocre sushi spots. But this one was actually pretty bad.  It was served room temperature and the texture tasted somewhat dry. This confirmed to me that the fish they use here is not the freshest and highest of quality. <br><br>In my opinion, they need to source better seafood and use less sauce/rice, or reduce their prices to match the quality. <br><br>+1 star for the ambiance<br>+1 for the concept,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Adrienne A,Oh man, where do I begin? <br><br>Everything I had was DELICIOUS! *****<br><br>Spicy Salmon- Perfect!<br><br>Spicy Toro- Perfect! <br><br>The Blue Crab was my favorite :) <br><br>I had no warning before I bit into the Uni special... my mouth went on a journey through the universe. So many flavors~<br><br>Thanking my lucky stars !! I was given fresh raw wasabi... I ate all of it. I think it got me high :D just kidding, I know it did!!! <br>Even the wasabi you are normally given here was the best I&#39;ve ever had, as well as the ginger.<br><br>The Chefs oh ma gaaaaaaaaaaaaaa GORGEOUS!!! Faints :) <br><br>Big crazy parking lot!!!!! I will avoid places if parking is to difficult, but for this? For this I will fight! I will take you DOWWWN!!! LoL <br><br>Fantastic service! Great decor to stare at after you&#39;re high from the wasabi and delicious food :D <br><br>Nice restrooms! <br><br>See you in my dreams!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Yoder O,Totally blown away by how delicious the food was. I&#39;m giving this place a 5 star although is has some cons but the food and experience was that good.<br><br>Food choice: GO x2 (mind-blowingly Delicious)<br><br>Pros: The hand roll is made fresh right in front of you and served one at a time. It&#39;s so freaking delicious that you can&#39;t wait for the another one and then another one. The sushi chefs are super friendly and engaging.<br><br>Cons: The place is small but intimate. We came with a party of 8 and had to be split into 4 groups which was awkward to yell across the room to talk to a friend. The prices are also a bit out of hand but thankfully we came at the grand opening week and got a buy one get one free deal. Lastly, getting the food fresh out of the chef&#39;s hand was so unique but also means waiting around for 2 chefs to serve 20 people can be irritating.<br><br>Overall: I will be coming back and can&#39;t wait to try everything on the menu.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Sang P,Came here around 11:15 AM on a weekday. The place was about 30% full. I ordered the &#34;GO&#34; because why not GO all out?<br><br>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to compare sushi places in the US to the ones in Japan. The style that J Wata serves is very similar to the extremely popular Kazunori in Los Angeles. Don&#39;t expect sashimi inside your temaki. Also, the rice wasn&#39;t quite seasoned for sushi (don&#39;t expect akasu or komai, etc) but that&#39;s still okay. I think it could be borderline pretentious if someone puts that much effort into the rice for San Diego - given that the price range does not justify that much detail anyway - who cares!  The rule still stands similar to Japan and the US alike: eat as soon as possible when the chef hands it to you to keep the crispiness of the seaweed.<br><br>The temakis were good - I liked the lobster the most. I&#39;d love to try to Uni+Ikura next time but I was pretty full from the meal. In the future, I&#39;d prefer more handrolls with sashimi in them but I know that&#39;s pretty difficult to do given the prep time, etc.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jessica S,Traditionally, temaki is made from leftovers and packed as a lunch, SO only in America will you see it offered in a restaurant and as an exotic, high-end dinner item. This &#39;bar&#39; serves temaki strictly; seating is very limited. Typically, temaki is cone-shaped, but this restaurant and others have been going with the super hip &#39;rolled taco&#39; version. Nori is held over a flame to warm and crisp it, then the rice is packed in with the protein on top. It is rolled by your chef and handed to you on the spot. <br><br>We came during the soft opening, so there wasn&#39;t much of a wait just before 6pm hit. Options at the time offered 3 set menus and some items a la carte. A little irked that the set menus included a little disclaimer of &#39;no sharing&#39;. Who the hell are they to tell me how to eat MY food that I paid for!? Anyways, I went for *Shi* which included blue crab, negi yellowtail, spicy salmon, and bay scallop for $16.75. Sound a bit pricey? Indeed it is and you won&#39;t feel full after 4. I did mightily enjoyed the bay scallops the most though -- such a pop of freshness with the creamy mayo serving as a marinade. The others options were alright. Most seemed to rely heavily on the marinade. In that respect I did enjoy the *wagyu shabu* which I did have to order a la carte for a $7.75! This did not have a marinade and you were able to enjoy the lusciousness of the meat itself. The offering of wagyu was small and because of that I don&#39;t believe the $7.75 was a fair price. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the *negi toro* as it had a funny texture since it was a bit mashed up. I guess that&#39;s how it normally is so it does take some getting used to. <br><br>Nori was ever so slightly warm and it maybe offered a little crunch. Rice was ON POINT though. In addition to the freshness of the fish, the rice is definitely another important component and they make it right here; moist, but firm. <br><br>I am fairly certain the owner of RakiRaki will kill it though since there is nothing like this San Diego. I have a love-hate relationship with the man, but he offered a polished menu in a very well thought out and aesthetically pleasing restaurant. Congratulations on capitalizing on the next cool concept Junya Watanabe!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Seth S,This place used to be amazing.  I went today for lunch and half the items weren&#39;t available.  Seems to me that if they aren&#39;t going out of business they would have more supply.  Disappointing because the food was really good.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Candice L,I mean, wow! First of all, great service and the was very friendly! I came for a BOGO promotion during their grand opening so there was a bit of a line but well worth it! I got the GO option which has Maine Lobster included, my fav! The soy was is double fermented (bomb) and the wasabi wasn&#39;t that fake stuff.  Not a huge spicy tuna fan but this wasn&#39;t the best spicy tuna I&#39;ve ever had! It was FRESH! Must come here for some hand-rolls!  A bit on the smaller side, but he beat quality.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Isabella B,After the successes of RakiRaki and Pokiritto chef-owner Junya Watanabe has launched another restaurant concept - this time focusing on temaki (hand rolls). While there are plenty of sushi places that serve rolls or nigiri, not a lot of restaurants even offer temaki on the menu, much less exclusively serve them. Before this restaurant existed I could only get good handrolls from the famous Sugarfish as part of their set menu. At least now I don&#39;t have to go that far for temaki.<br><br>LOCATION: Convoy/Kearny Mesa in the same complex as the original Rakiraki and Pokiritto. As with any other restaurant in that area, parking situation&#39;s awful but at least this is my only negative critique about the restaurant.<br><br>VENUE: The restaurant&#39;s pretty small. A central sushi bar seats 22. Three to four chefs toast the nori in these special clay pots that contain the flame. <br><br>SERVICE: Friendly service. Hostess kept on asking us how our experience was. <br>The temaki is assembled right in front of you; they toast the nori, scoop the rice and fish, roll it and hand it to you. No need for chopsticks and oshibori is provided to wipe your hands before touching the sushi.<br><br>Our party chose from a set menu. My mom also included salmon sashimi ($7.25) as well as an additional negi yellowtail temaki ($4.75). Salmon sashimi was fresh. Didn&#39;t need so much sesame and soy sauce.<br><br>Set Menu - Go [5] ($21.75)<br>There is a progression in the seafood that goes from the lightest to the heaviest.<br>1. Maine Lobster: the lightest temaki, as it should be. The lobster is already diluted with rice. They use a good quality lobster for this roll.<br>2. Spicy Toro: Salmon and tuna have both a spicy and a negi variation. The fish is pounded until the final product resembles cat food. There is enough hotness for it to be noticeable but not too much that it takes over the fish.<br>3. Negi Salmon: The negi in this case refers to green onion. In this case it lessens the fishy flavor. Since I&#39;m not served the fatty parts of the fish I like #2 and #3 equally.<br>4. Bay Scallop: The bay scallop has mayonnaise in it and served warm. Final product is still quite delicious.<br>5. Blue Crab: Lots of good crab meat. Though I prefer Sugarfish&#39;s version, the blue crab is still fresh.<br>Rice - Sushi-grade rice cooked in a small batch technique seasoned with 3 types of vinegar.<br>Nori - Gold labeled seaweed sourced from Yamamotoyama<br><br>My parents and I came during their soft opening. We were pretty impressed with our experience in terms of quality of food and service. I could see this restaurant ending up in our regular rotation for places to go out, especially as good Japanese food is hard to find. Just bear the parking.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Myphuong L,TIP: Do not come starving. You will leave disappointed and still hungry then make your way down to Caldron to fill yourself on the puffle like we did. I would consider this a snack or delicate meal.<br><br>Came here at 6:30pm during soft opening (6/10/) and the place had three others seated. Which was a bit awkward when literally everyone can hear your conversations due to the confined space. Especially the chef directly in front of you.<br><br>We were told each roll was crafted carefully and recommended to be eaten as soon as it was handed to you. That&#39;s exactly what we did. It was so good that I forgot to take photos! We ordered the 4 roll set menu and the scallop was my number one but they were all delicious.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Omid F,Ordered the Hamachi Kama appetizer and received it well after we were done with our food. Don&#39;t call something that takes 45 minutes to make an appetizer especially if you are going to serve it to your customers after they are done with their food, that ultimately makes it a dessert!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Sandra S,My friend and I came at around 10:45am during the soft opening, and there wasn&#39;t a wait, plus plenty of parking in the notoriously difficult parking lot that the restaurant is located in. The restaurant is very small, with about twenty seats at a sushi counter top. In the middle, the chefs make the hand rolls, while people sit around the sushi bar. <br><br>I was somewhat skeptical of how good a hand roll could be, but to my surprise, the experience was very good. We went for the four-piece hand roll set that came with spicy salmon, scallops, yellowtail, and blue crab. My favorite of the four was yellowtail, since it was the sashimi in its pure form without any additional toppings or add ins. The scallop and blue crab rolls had fillings mixed with a mayonnaise type of sauce, and the spicy salmon was only mildly spicy.<br><br>The rice was soft and well seasoned, and the nori was crispy and warm. The cool fish contrasted well with the warm rice and nori, and I highly recommend eating it the second the chef hands it to you! The service was also very good, and the waitress was very attentive of our needs throughout the dining experience. I feel like this place will get busy really soon, so I would recommend coming early or before it opens to ensure a spot. Also, this restaurant isn&#39;t too good for large crowds, but it&#39;s perfect for a 2-3 people lunch date.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Walter M,First things first, the price will probably give pause to many &#34;sushi&#34; lovers out there, but the small, intimate setting, welcoming décor and quality of product will keep you here.<br><br>Unfortunately here in Western culture sushi has become synonymous with rolls where the filling is wrapped inside out of the rice and cut. Based on sales and knowledge most people think nigiri or rolls, but the more true versions to eat are the maki and temaki rolls where the nori is on the outside with a proper proportion of fillings. All too often places overstuff rolls with rice and filling and they drown in sauces and toppings. <br><br>It&#39;s small, quiet, the customer service from both the chef and staff is amazing. I found the salmon sashimi was a great appetizer. The bay scallop was delicate. Something you&#39;ll notice is the premium ingredients. The rice in and of itself is great, the nori, properly toasted and crisp, the balance of rice to fish is perfect. The simplicity begets tradition. <br><br>I actually only came here because the lines next door were too long and I was parked illegally. They have some kinks to work out on the operations side, the marketing side and to convert an entire sushi people to unlearn a culture. It&#39;s ambitious to do something different, but I think to realty grab the hearts and minds of a demographic it has to be approachable, even if mildly to the wallet and maybe in not such a densely concentrated Asian food epicienter.<br><br>Update to come.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Jannie T,The whole experience was very underwhelming for me. Service was decent, I wasn&#39;t too happy that I had to ask my chef almost each time what handroll he was serving me. He would put it in my hand and walk away without saying anything. The idea of the nori being crispy sounds cool but parts of the nori would sometimes get stuck to the roof of my mouth. I really liked bay scallops and the blue crab hand rolls. I ordered the ikura and uni handroll and was NOT thrilled there was a mint (?) leaf in there! It overtook the flavor of the ikura and uni. Sigh :(<br><br>Glad I came here for the BOGO set offer. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back. Handrolls were 3.5/5 stars good but not worth the size and price I&#39;m paying for.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Scout B,I&#39;ve never had sushi of any kind that could compare to this place. I&#39;m not an expert at all but I think anyone can tell how fresh and delicious it is. <br><br>Another thing I&#39;ve noticed is that unlike most sushi places or even just restaurants in general - it may seem that three or four little temaki rolls won&#39;t be enough, and usually I&#39;ll walk out after sushi still somehow not feeling full after maybe 2-3 times as much. <br>The seafood here is so high quality that it&#39;s fulfilling in pretty small quantities. That&#39;s how good it is - it&#39;s real, pure food, not empty calories. I dunno but that was honestly a bit surprising to me, in a very good way of course. The appetizers are fantastic just like the temaki itself, of course.<br><br>It&#39;s not even that expensive, either! They have lunch specials and happy hour that go even cheaper without sacrificing any quality.<br><br>The chefs and servers are super nice, too, and I tend to see them casually chatting with customers as they&#39;re preparing food. The entire place has a really relaxing vibe and it&#39;s a perfect size. <br><br>The only real issue that I&#39;ve had here is sometimes your order will get messed up - like one of the sets of temaki is meant to come with miso soup, which never did last time I went. And you have to make sure to mark everything correctly on the menu, another time my friend made a mistake but let the server know and still was served things she didn&#39;t mean to order. <br>None of that is a big issue at all, though. Everyone&#39;s so nice that I&#39;m sure if you let them know they made a mistake they&#39;d be sure to fix it - we just didn&#39;t bother because the food was so good we didn&#39;t even care. <br><br>So yeah, be sure you get what you&#39;re ordering but as long as you don&#39;t have any allergies, no matter what you get it&#39;s going to be delicious!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Aaron C,J Wata is the best sushi experience in San Diego by far. And I say experience and not restaurant, because coming here is quite an EXPERIENCE. Fresh made to order hand rolls, each individually crafted one by one and to be eaten right after handed to you. Cuts of some of the best seafood, atop perfectly cooked sushi rice, wrapped in freshly roasted seaweed. <br>Nothing complicated, just the impeccable quality of every ingredient that you sure can taste... even the soy sauce tastes amazing!<br><br>My favorite hand rolls are the scallop, Maine lobster, and negi toro! But you really can&#39;t go wrong with anything else they have! <br><br>They also have rotating appetizers and are always good as well. Be sure to check out what seasonal items they have when you go. <br><br>I also have to applaud how I receive consistently superior service here. All the sushi chefs are friendly and attentive, and they time the delivery of the rolls perfectly. Meaning your next hand roll comes a few minutes after you finish your previous one.<br><br>So do yourself a favor and try temaki style sushi at J Wata. You won&#39;t be disappointed!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Christopher L,Temaki is a concept that is new to me personally and honestly I enjoyed it. <br><br>We went for their grand opening event where it was buy one set menu, get one free which was a great deal! <br><br>We were seated right way when the place opened and were told about how their restaurant system works. After ordering our set menu, a chef would make our rolls and literally hand it to us one by one. They suggested we eat it right away to get the full effect of the roasted seaweed texture along with whatever filling we got. <br><br>We got the Go set menu which everything was pretty tasty. They use this sweet cream sauce to mix their fish in which complimented the crab, lobster, and scallops really well. I can imagine for the seafood connoisseurs though that they would feel like the cream over powered the actual meat but whatever.  The scallop to me was amazing. It&#39;s individual sweetness came through perfectly. The roasted seaweed wrap had a perfect crunch, something I&#39;ve never experienced before. I guess the fact that it is roasted seconds before it is served to you really makes a difference. <br><br>The vibe I got from the restaurant was pretty cool. It was like modern and classic japanese decor infused together. <br><br>The whole meal experience was laid back and gave you the opportunity to relax and chat with whoever you&#39;re eating with. Don&#39;t expect a quick meal especially if there are a lot of people being served. The rolls came every few minutes which allowed me to savor each bit and get all the flavors. <br><br>I recommend coming here to give it a try and see if you like it!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Steve H,Soft opening as of 7/7, so menu may change.<br><br>It&#39;s in the TightParKing Stripmall with RakiRaki.  Don&#39;t even try..  street park three blocks away and walk.<br><br>This place is all bar seating, one big U shape.  This makes the service personal and direct.  Friendly, fresh, and.. uniquely human.  The chef makes each handroll and hands it to you directly.  Pacing is up to you.  Very nice, and an easy place to dine solo or small parties.<br><br>I went with the midsize 4-roll combo.  No substitutions, but cheaper than the same rolls individually.<br><br>I&#39;d call it lunch-sized..  you won&#39;t leave stuffed or starving.  These are open ended rolls, not the more common conical ones.  It&#39;s just rice and mixed fish ingredients, fresh, but without the greens and garnishes you might be expecting.<br><br>The flavors were good, but the hand roll format just doesn&#39;t floor me.  It&#39;s smaller than a sushi roll, and more seaweed-shell/nori than regular nigiri sushi.  The contents are good, but get a bit overshadowed in all that crunch and wrap, especially near the ends.<br><br>Best value on the menu was the hamachi sashimi, with jalapeno slices.  Very fresh thick slices, artfully arranged.  I would get that again.<br><br>Iced green tea was just a UCC can, not the fresh matcha you get at Ken&#39;s.  Wasabi was really weak, just vanished.  Value was a bit on the expensive side, especially compared to Pokeritto next door.<br><br>Service was very helpful and friendly, but this one-format menu might not be for everyone.  Five stars for service and novelty, but I think once was enough for me.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Claire D,Very happy that San Diego now has a temaki bar! Ever since I went to Kazunori in LA I was hoping we would get one. They are still in their soft opening so the hours aren&#39;t set. They would be an ideal quick but delicious (and pricey) lunch, although parking might take too long to visit on a standard lunch break. Really, that parking lot is insane. And some times you can&#39;t even find anything 2 blocks on the street in any direction! Anyway...<br><br>The menu is simple and the quality of the food is good. The only problem I had is that the rolls kind of fell apart a bit. If you tried to turn it anything but vertical rice fell into the soy. If you held it vertical and took a bite, rice fell out the bottom. Maybe this is something they could fix in the future. My husband and I got 4 handrolls each and it was a $40 lunch without tip. The freshly crisped nori makes it so good though. I like it and hope to come back soon.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Alanna C,Came here for the BOGO grand opening event. The wait was around 25 min to get seated ( there are only around 25 or so seats- would be difficult for large parties). <br><br>Sushi is always on the expensive side... and this place is no exception, each hand roll is around $4-$5. And around 4 bites in size. It was nice they were having the BOGO otherwise this restaurant would be slightly out of my price range. <br><br>The service was quick, after ordering (shi and go sets) it took about 7 min for the chef to greet us and then another 3-4 min to get our roll. Their style is to serve one roll at a time for ultimate freshness. Between each roll there was a 3-4 min wait for the next. <br><br>My favorites were the lobster (very tender and the crunch of the seaweed added texture to the lobster) and the blue crab. The scallops had too much mayonnaise for me. I also enjoyed the spicy salmon.<br><br>The concept of this place is innovative and new so I feel like that will attract people even if the food is pricey and parking is somewhat difficult. <br><br>I would probably be back if they had another deal just on pricey side for me although the food is delicious and atmosphere is nice!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Ryan L,Went with a friend for the grand opening event. The atmosphere was pretty cool. I liked the art on the walls, music, and lighting. Service was ok. <br><br>We were seated in these lower seats in the dining area which were kind of secluded. It was  out of the way so we couldn&#39;t see the sushi chef making stuff and he would only briefly come over to give us our rolls. We could also see the trash behind the counter and the guy bussing dirty dishes was coming right in front of us.<br><br>The menu has sets of handrolls that go from 3, 4, or 5 rolls or vegetarian as well as a la carte rolls, appetizers, etc. <br><br>We got the &#34;go(五)&#34; set which had 5 handrolls:<br>Salmon, lobster, scallop, spicy tuna, and blue crab. Which would have normally cost 21.75 per person but it was buy 1 set get 1 set free. Salmon and blue crab were good, but scallop and lobster had a lot of mayo and you could pretty much only taste the mayo. Spicy tuna was good, but for 21.75 I feel like you could go to pokkiritto and get something for cheaper. The portions are small and they do 1 roll at a time to pace you out, but we definitely left the restaurant hungry. <br><br>For the price and quality I definitely wouldn&#39;t go again, but its definitely something you can go to say you&#39;ve gone.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Tiffanie L,Pretty comparable to Kazu Nori in LA!<br><br>I ordered the Shi (4) and got the Blue Crab, Negi Yellowtail, Spicy Salmon and Bay Scallop. I really enjoyed every hand roll on this set menu. I liked the fact that they added green onion to the yellowtail so it gave the roll a nice crunch. The Blue Crab and Bay Scallop had the perfect amount of mayo and it wasn&#39;t overly creamy! <br><br>Pricing: A little over $16 for 4<br>Parking: private lot + street parking,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Rammy C,The wait is worth it. If you&#39;re a major sashimi fan and love handrolls this place is amazing. Handrolls come as you finish so that you get them fresh and enjoy the full flavors of the fish and toasted nori. The negi toro, scallops, blue crab and waygu are the best. Order a lot cuz you&#39;ll want more. <br><br>And chef Brian was so great to us.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Maria P,&#34;INCREDIBLE with Amazing Fish quality&#34;<br><br>THE BEST HAND-ROLL IN AMERICA. <br>I am a Japanese. I have eaten sushi and sushi hand rolls everywhere in US. Haven&#39;t found anything like this!!<br><br> <br>This place is just opened and the décor is modern contempo look with some Japanese themed Anime murals on the wall. I definitely dig the edgy look and minimalist feel. The wait staff was very courteous and attentive to my requests.<br><br>Now onto the food.<br>Too keep things fresh, the chefs prepare each roll one-by-one, rather than sending them all out at once.<br>The chefs toast seaweed each time with Hibachi (fire bowl) to make it extra crisp.  <br><br>I had salmon Sashimi, Blue Crab, Negi Yellowtail, Maine Lobster, Wagyu Shabu hand rolls .The price is very reasonable. <br><br>My favorite one was Wagyu Shabu Roll. Shabu-shabu is one of the popular Japanese dishes. The chef boiled the thinly-sliced Wagyu beef in special hot broth to cook it and made hand-roll with it. It was absolutely delicious!!!<br><br>I am truly impressed with the quality level of ingredients of fish and meat here. I will definitely come back with my friends next week!!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Gina L,They were extremely accommodating of my dietary needs. In fact, they asked about them before we even ordered. The temaki was outstanding. Will be back again soon!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Lauren G,Such a great experience to add to the Convoy area!<br><br>Freshly opened, this Temaki Bar really presents high quality ingredients and fresh hand rolls to guests. It&#39;s the perfect place for a date or a meaningful catch up with friends or family.<br><br>You are seated at a rectangular open bar with the chefs in the center. There&#39;s limited seating, so smaller parties definitely will work better - which also helps with the intimate attention you get from the chefs.<br><br>The walls have some amazing art to really add to the hip and classy atmosphere.<br><br>There are a few preset menus and individual rolls you can order - each with their own special umami to them! <br><br>I had the first set on the menu, Sashimi Appetizer, and a Wagyu Beef Hand Roll and was very impressed with the quality.<br><br>Highly recommend the savory Sashimi Appetizer! It meltsssssss into your taste buds!<br><br>Our servers were very nice and attentive and our chef who presented the hand rolls to us over the counter recommended we eat them quickly to enjoy the full quality and perfected temperatures.<br><br>A really great dining experience to try and live the good food life!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,sar a,Basically all they serve is hand rolls. They&#39;re not bad but the ambience is weird and doesn&#39;t feel authentic watching this young kid making it in front of me. Overall awkward service with not much authenticity.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Kyle C,Kept the expectations really low walking in but wanted to see if toasted seaweed was really worth it. Seated in the observation booth and started out with the hamachi yellow tail sashimi. Fresh and fatty. The ponzu sauce and jalapeño over it was really good. Ended up getting the 4 course: blue crab, yellow tail, bay scallop and salmon. Honestly seeing them toast the seaweed and presenting it to you was a one of a kind experience. Not to sound like a effing snob but fuck that was delicious. The rice, with the freshness of the seafood and the crunch of the seaweed. The best hand rolls hands down. A beer, the sashimi and 4 rolls ran me $30. Came 40 minutes after open and not that crowded. Not sure how the wait would be during rush but still pretty good. <br><br>This is quality over quantity so I wouldn&#39;t expect to get full but who wants to feel like shit after eating high quality sushi. <br><br>My chef and another patron found out we were from the 562 as well so the experience of meeting familiar people was nice. Ask for James for your chef!,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Collin M,An amazing experience highlighted by phenomenal fresh food, prepared in a traditional setting and manner that give you a intimate experience with this fun personal staff,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Reba G,The BEST hand rolls I&#39;ve had. The combo of the cold fish and toasted nori is an epiphany, why hasn&#39;t anyone done this before? Also they make the rolls cylindrical vs cone shaped so you get an equal amount of fish and rice in each bite. Everything is so fresh, and the customer service is excellent. Make a reservation and try to go during the least busiest time. We went On a Friday at 1, the parking situation is very tough here, very small lot. They have good lunch specials but I would recommend the set menu.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Marivic R,Hubby and I really enjoyed their hand rolls, especially the bay scallops! We loved it so much we ended up ordering 3 of the Go set menu each consisting of 5 hand rolls!!! The only complaint I have is how they give you a small amount of their premiun soy sauce and a tiny ball of wasabi (see pic). Throughout the meal, I had to ask for 3 refills (which is a hassle) and yet it was not enough. Finding parking in this place is close to impossible, we&#39;re lucky enough to find street parking across the street. But they do have this 2 story parking structure across the street by Jasmine restaurant charging only $1 per hour.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Tom L,Finally a Temaki Bar on convoy!<br><br>Short: Slightly pricy fancy sushi <br><br>Long: Coming from LA, one of my favorite things to do is to go get &#34;fancy&#34; sushi. J / Wata is a new hip place to go on Convoy if you want to experience that. <br><br>My favorite thing about this place is that they hand you one roll at a time; you&#39;ll get it fresh! I got the Shi which gave me crab, yellowtail, salmon and scallop. As you would expect, the fish was fresh and tasted good, not too chunky and overly chewy. <br><br>It is a bit pricy, and honestly value for sushi could be better elsewhere but when you&#39;re here you feel a sense of luxury.,
J Wata Temaki Bar,Yoav L,I&#39;ve been waiting for this place to open for a while. So fresh and so good. <br>Every single thing in the menu is top notch and won&#39;t disappoint. <br>The only problem I see is that price for lunch per person will be around $30 which is kinda of pricey even tough it&#39;s super fresh and tasty.,
