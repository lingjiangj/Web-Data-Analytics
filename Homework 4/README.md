Twitter API and Sentiment 

In this Homework you are required to use the twitter stream listener from the tweepy library to obtain the most recent 50 tweets about a specific keyword. Once you have obtained the 50 tweets, use Microsoft Azure text analytics to obtain the sentiment of each tweet.  Then report the average sentiment of all the tweets for that specific keyword.  You should structure your code so that it can work with any keyword provided.  You should ask for the keyword as an input for the user.
